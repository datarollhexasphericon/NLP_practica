In particular, my standard PLA profiles don't work, I need to raise the bed temperature up to 70C and increase overall temperatures before I start getting good results. Once you get it working, it prints fine and has good color and surface quality; I have gotten lots of good prints out of the one spool I've bought.

EDIT/UPDATE: so not long after I wrote this, it started acting up...hard. I retract many of my previous statements.<br /><br />1) I still can\\u2019t shake the nozzle drag issue - ive re adjusted every e-nut (multiple times), changed nozzles, re adjusted the gantry to ensure they square/plumb. But...I can\\u2019t shake it. I also have a friend with an LK4 - same issue. Strange.<br /><br />2) had to replace the nozzle - clogged. Also, after more digging found hot end wasn\\u2019t bolted down well. Whoever assembled it did a poor job.<br /><br />3) white screen of death. It\\u2019s a Longer thing.<br /><br />4) discovered the belt on the x gantry is slightly too big, and is not designed well where it\\u2019s bolted down. The end result? The x-gantry belt rubs continuously on the extruder. It CAN be fixed, sure, but a PITA, no doubt.<br /><br />I\\u2019m gonna pull this down to a two star printer and don\\u2019t recommend it to the new crowd. It\\u2019ll give a lot of headaches if you end up with a lemon. You\\u2019ll end up having to make changes shortly after a few prints - it doesn\\u2019t hold up.<br /><br />This is not my first printer- my ender still prints flawlessly without issue - for years. This has given me more headaches than I have time to deal with in less than a month.<br /><br />5/10.<br /><br />OLD review:<br /><br />This is a great, inexpensive printer with a large(r) print volume compared to an ender. Worth the buy, but not as good as a cr-10.<br /><br />Print quality: per dollar is very decent, although the nozzle drags harder than I\\u2019d like to see, and I can\\u2019t seem to shake it. Let\\u2019s be clear, it\\u2019s not quite the quality of an Ender...but I\\u2019m making an entire Ironman costume cosplay on it and it\\u2019s holding up well.<br /><br />Setup: Setup is very quick. 20 mins Max, including the leveling. Touchscreen works fine so far.<br /><br />Adhesion. Ridiculously good. Honesty the best I\\u2019ve seen. Actually it can sometimes be quite hard to get it off the bed sometimes...but I\\u2019d much prefer this for the tall and wide prints I do.<br /><br />Overall, 7/10. Yes, worth the buy, but not perfect by any means.\",\n          \"Handy to have & easy to use!

              "6371   works well, buts its no cr-10s. edit/update: so not long after i wrote this, it started acting up...hard. i retract many of my previous statements.1) i still cant shake the nozzle drag issue - ive re adjusted every e-nut (multiple times), changed nozzles, re adjusted the gantry to ensure they square/plumb. but...i cant shake it. i also have a friend with an lk4 - same issue. strange.2) had to replace the nozzle - clogged. also, after more digging found hot end wasnt bolted down well. whoever assembled it did a poor job.3) white screen of death. its a longer thing.4) discovered the belt on the x gantry is slightly too big, and is not designed well where its bolted down. the end result? the x-gantry belt rubs continuously on the extruder. it can be fixed, sure, but a pita, no doubt.im gonna pull this down to a two star printer and dont recommend it to the new crowd. itll give a lot of headaches if you end up with a lemon. youll end up having to make changes shortly after a few prints - it doesnt hold up.this is not my first printer- my ender still prints flawlessly without issue - for years. this has given me more headaches than i have time to deal with in less than a month.5/10.old review:this is a great, inexpensive printer with a large(r) print volume compared to an ender. worth the buy, but not as good as a cr-10.print quality: per dollar is very decent, although the nozzle drags harder than id like to see, and i cant seem to shake it. lets be clear, its not quite the quality of an ender...but im making an entire ironman costume cosplay on it and its holding up well.setup: setup is very quick. 20 mins max, including the leveling. touchscreen works fine so far.adhesion. ridiculously good. honesty the best ive seen. actually it can sometimes be quite hard to get it off the bed sometimes...but id much prefer this for the tall and wide prints i do.overall, 7/10. yes, worth the buy, but not perfect by any means.   \n",
